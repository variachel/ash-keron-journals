After counter attacks forced the Katarine force back out to sea and a fragile treaty was wrought, the walls were strengthen to where they are today.

The green jewel that formed the centre of the sceptre's head is otherwise known as @JournalEntry[TmzuYbIXpACGFtOG]{The Lost Heart of O'Shan}. This jewel is thought to have been found and cut by a @JournalEntry[9UlCdwFrL4MjhZM6]{Meredin} jewel smith by the name of @JournalEntry[m5iabyLH5Qn2HOfQ]{Jas'Mar Sokur}. Sokur was a follower of the ancient Meredin goddess @JournalEntry[otK9yONQsAra44pA]{O'Shan}. He named the jewel in reference to one of the ancient tales of O'Shan. It was commissioned by the then emperor of Meredin. The emperor was pleased Sokur disappeared soon after. It is rumoured that the emperoro had him killed as he did not want him crafting one that could possibly outdo the Heart and the emperor must have the best in the world. Sokur's work is highly sought after.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"shadow-highlight\">The Head</strong>. The head itself is a gold latticed casement which opens and has a setting in which to place the jewel. It has long been thought that this was made by the legendary goldsmith @JournalEntry[6uzKtN95ObAtMHPC]{T'Vran Malgrave}. In general, pieces by him are sought after and would, if provenance could be verified, be worth an extraordinary amount of money. Its history is less clear than the Heart. Malgrave was also from Meredin. This piece of work was more than likely made before the Heart. It may well have been the emperors collection for some time before he was presented with the Heart.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"shadow-highlight\">The Staff</strong>. This has a setting at one end that will accept the head of the Sceptre. The staff is made from an ancient Yew Tree, that perhaps is still living. The people of Meredin believed in opposing forces coming together to become something more powerful. The staff made from the Yew Tree is benign. While the Heart was also, at some point was corrupted. The jewel and the staff put together and amplified by the golden lattice made the Sceptre very powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-header\">\n<h2>Corruption</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-content\">\n<p>The then emperor of Meredin, @JournalEntry[iGwebSINUU9E1Q4Y]{Pir'Lanash}, was not entirely sane and he studied the dark magics which led him to put these three elements together. With the Sceptre he maintained power long after he would naturally have died. His reign was not a pleasant one either. Finally he was taken down and the Sceptre broken and the pieces lost. But there have always been clues for those who knew where to look. Fortunately those people are very very few. Osric is dubious about finding all the pieces again but unless the Sceptre needs the wielding of those ancient magicks and they have been lost. No-one now lives who understands them.</p>\n<p>Osric has since stated that the meaning of Vor Layder in the ancient languages is <strong class=\"shadow-highlight\">'Stone of Dread and Fear'</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{}}

Having been married to the somewhat abusive, @JournalEntry[dLLpGbip8AOOh0cc]{Garan Conway}, a captain of the guards at @JournalEntry[DiwsEIwWYIJDolYf]{Claybrook Hall}, she became a widow upon Leon's well-placed blow to Conway's jaw during a fight instigated by Conway himself. To a certain degree he had good reason to be that belligerent as Leon had been having an affair with Esmeralda, the two having met during Leon's time a Claybrook Hall. That Esmeralda was physically abused by her husband was one of the main reasons that she fell into a relationship with Leon. Of course, she was as admiring of his charms as he was of hers.</p>\n<p>After her husband's death, she was retained by the Claybrooks. @JournalEntry[WYz4kk2jqwisWzSV]{Harland Claybrook}} had suspected that his guard captain was hurting Esmeralda but was initially reluctant to step into the relationship between the man and his wife, mainly as a matter of principle. Conway's abuse became too obvious though and Harland eventually had words with Garan Conway about his behaviour. He was most disappointed to find that his words had fallen of deaf ears. Harland perhaps would not have known but his words with Conway most likely resulted in more physical abuse on Esmeralda.</p>\n<p>On the day of his death and prior to trawling round the taverns in the centre of @JournalEntry[A0nlO3GdhBBbccXI]{Ragarth} and finding Leon, Conway had confronted his wife and left her battered and bleeding at their home. She was found by another lady's maid and the alarm was raised. Esmeralda was only just able to state that her husband had gone to the city looking for Leon. Harland and is brothers and a few men had left Claybrook Hall to find either or both. As it happened all that they did find was a gathering of people around the now deceased Garan Conway.</p>\n<p>They gathered as much information as possible from the witnesses there and organised a man-hunt for Leon. However, the latter had used his skills to avoid being seen leaving Ragarth, ultimately arriving at @JournalEntry[perljzDGXqwHE976]{Sanseer}.</p>\n<p>As Esmeralda recovered she was able to relate the whole story to Harland, @JournalEntry[6q2itmszETiwURTN]{Fran Claybrook} and @JournalEntry[WPJlWhrRKlZCaRxG]{Evan Claybrook}. The brothers had a great deal of sympathy for Esmeralda and Harland in particular felt some responsibility for her condition, believing that if he had acted more demonstrably and sooner that all of the recent events would have not transpired as they did. Esmeralda believes that the search for Leon was more a matter of being seen to do the right thing, especially as the full story of the fight became known.</p>\n<p>It was suggested to Esmeralda that she remain with the family in their employ should she so wish and that she should, perhaps, revert to her maiden name of Hayset. Evan further suggested that she should use an alternative version of her first name and so she became known as Relda Hayset from that point on.</p>\n<p>She believes that had the Claybrooks caught up with Leon they would have sought some justice or reparation but she suspects that the brothers, on learning the full tale of her life with Conway, felt that her dead husband more or less deserved what had been coming to him.</p>\n<p>Relda will aid Leon and Grim as she still cares for the errant rogue and is grateful that he, despite the extremity of the solution, freed her from \"that bastard of a husband\".</p>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{}}

His skill was in cutting gems. </p>\n<p>He had begun his apprenticeship when he was but 10 years old. His master, Narul of Margalen, was as cruel a master as other tales have told, nonetheless, young Jas'Mar learned his craft well. It may come as no surprise that his ambition was to one day surpass his master in craftmanship - a subtle repayment for the years of suffering under his tutelage.</p>\n<p>The time came when Jas'Mar Sokur began to make a name for himself. By now, living in the age-old city of Coren Tar, he had set up his own business with loans from the local commercial chambers. Despite his hard work, it was luck that brought his creativenes to the attention of the wealthy. Overcome with Jas'Mar's skill in crafting gems that shone and tricked the eye, that realised the likenesses of nature - trees and animals, that glittered on the fingers of beautiful women, the rich and powerful soon were clamouring for his work. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-header\">\n<h2>O'Shan</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-content\">\n<p>Jas'Mar Sokur was a worshipper of the mighty yet broken-hearted goddess @JournalEntry[otK9yONQsAra44pA]{O'Shan}. He was captured by the tales of Her exploits and saddened by the tales of the loss of Her lover, the god Jarec. </p>\n<p>It was, therefore, only natural for him to name his - as it turned out - last piece after his precious goddess.</p>\n<p>The emperor, @JournalEntry[iGwebSINUU9E1Q4Y]{Pir'Lanash}, was desirous of an example of Sokur's work as by now tales of his skill had reached so high. Through agents, the emperor comissioned a piece which he stated must be of emerald. For his inspiration Sokur looked to the stories of O'Shan and Jarec. He crafted, what he considered his finest piece yet - The Lost Heart of O'Shan. When it was completed, he was summmoned to the palace where he presented it to Pir'Lanash.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the emperor and all who saw this masterpiece, were of similar opinion - this jewel was above and beyond all else they had seen. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-header\">\n<h2>Sokur's Disappearance</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-content\">\n<p>But the emperor was jealous and his intentions for this jewel egregious. Now that he had the most beautiful gem in the land, he must remain he only one who could claim such a thing. Not long after Sokur had left the palace and returned home, he was taken by the emperor's own guard. His true fate is unknown, but never again did he grace the streets of Coren Tar, nor craft another piece like to the Heart.</p>\n<p>That the Heart of O'Shan was subsequently corrupted by the Emperor Pir'Lanash is another tale.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{}}

She did spill some beans however, prior to spilling her guts that is. Spluttered out the name of a man in Halith in the end, one Doren con Grath, who she thought might have more information.

However, Pir'Lanash was an unstable man, constantly troubled since childhood. His father had endeavoued to help him in many ways but the child rebelled until his predilictions became so bad that he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p>It is thought that this is the time that he began studying the darker mystical arts. Meredin had long been known, and is still so today, for its belief in mysticism and <em>pra'nor</em>, 'magick'. Study of the darker side of pra'nor had been expressly forbidden centuries before. How Pir'Lanash acquired the texts and therefore the knowledge of such things is unknown. </p>\n<p>Ten years into his incarceration, his father, still a relatively young man, died suddenly, his body found in a viscious rictus. Most put his down to a disease hitherto unknown, but later events made some suspect that it was the vengeance of his son.</p>\n<p>Despite being held imprisoned, Pir'Lanash was not poorly treated - he was the Emperor's son after all. Also despite this, the laws of Meredin succession still applied and Pir'Lanash had now to be set free as the new Emperor.</p>\n<p>His investiture went smoothly. Pir'Lanash appeared to have been cured of the impulsiveness and strange habits that had blighted his youth. His reign was benign and the people were glad. He was lauded. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Many wives did he have, m</span>any fine gifts was he brought and none finer than @JournalEntry[TmzuYbIXpACGFtOG]{The Lost Heart of O'Shan}, a piece that Pir'Lanash had commissioned. As the people were to find out, this jewel and two other pieces of master craftsmanship were brought together by the Emperor to create @JournalEntry[KZD853QxggjvXUS5]{The Vor Layer Sceptre}. With this in his hand, Pir'Lanash wrought bloody revenge on those who had incarcerated him and made his people suffer for his amusement.</p>\n<p>Many decrees did he make and such was his control of the soldiery of the land that the merest misdemeanour was punished by cruel death. He abandoned treaties with the continents, he banned revelry, re-introduced slavery and torture. He banned the use of all metals except iron and steel and gold in the making of things.</p>\n<p>His cruel, tyrannical reigh lasted decades until a small group of people finally discerned a way to rid their land of this monster of an Emperor. They found that it had long been held that the dark arts were susceptible to one thing - bronze. Pir'Lanash's banning of such a metal made sense. The conspiracy grew slowly over many years, the group slowly infiltrated the palace until finally the opportunity arose.</p>\n<p>The Emperor had become infatuated with his own cruelty to the extent that he thought of almost nothing else. He lost sight of or could not conceive of anyone strong enough to challenge him. And, indeed none did. </p>\n<p>The dagger blow came from behind from a man the Emperor had come to trust. A dagger, its blade made from purest bronze, plunged into his back. A single thrust that pierced his heart, a single thrust that was enough to bring all the Emperor craved to ruin. It is rumoured that Pir'Lanash died with a look of incredulity on his face, his body turning to dust before his very eyes.</p>\n<p>The staff was broken apart into the three elements that made it up. Rather than destroy these, it was decided that they would be hidden across the world where none would find them. All books of the dark arts (that could be found - and a Great Cleansing sought them out) were destroyed. Pir'Lanash had died without progeny, although it is likely that any child of his would have been killed. The man who had dealt the blow that had killed him was proclaimed Emperor.

His father had died prior to his birth and his mother was killed by a man who robbed her as she returned from the market. Left alone, at the age of nine, Jas'Mar had to fend for himself.  He scrounged and thieved using his wit to evade being caught until he attempted to steal from a well known craftsman by the name of Narul <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">of Margalen</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">. Narul caught Jas'Mar in the act but rather than taking the boy to the authorities asked about the reasons he was living on the streets. Jas'Mar related his tale after which, in a feat of great altruism, Master Narul offered him a position as his appreentice.</span></p>\n<p>Jas'Mar thought that if nothing else, this represented a way in which to take advantage of Narul and accepted. As it turned out Narul was a master gem cutter and Jas'Mar found this endeavour fascinating. Not only that, he seemed to have natural skill in fashioning precious and semi-precious stones.</p>\n<p>He had begun his apprenticeship when he was but 10 years old. Sadly, the act of making Jas'Mar his apprentice was virtually  Narul 's only act of kindness towards Jas'Mar.  He was as cruel a master as other tales have told, nonetheless, young Jas'Mar learned his craft well. It may come as no surprise that his ambition was to one day surpass his master in craftmanship - a subtle repayment for the years of suffering under his tutelage.</p>\n<p>The time came when Jas'Mar Sokur began to make a name for himself. By now, living in the age-old city of Coren Tar, he had set up his own business with loans from the local commercial chambers. Despite his hard work, it was luck that brought his creativenes to the attention of the wealthy. Overcome with Jas'Mar's skill in crafting gems that shone and tricked the eye, that realised the likenesses of nature - trees and animals, that glittered on the fingers of beautiful women, the rich and powerful soon were clamouring for his work. </p>\n<p>Word of his skill reached the Emperor Pir'Lanash, who commissioned his to craft a jewel of surpassing beauty. the jewel he was told must be of emerald. Jas'Mar followed the goddess O'Shan and, inspired by the tale of Her lost love, cut a gem in the shape of a heart. He named it @JournalEntry[TmzuYbIXpACGFtOG]{The Lost Heart of O'Shan}.</p>\n<p>The Emperor was exultant when Jas'Mar presented him with his finished work. Pir'Lanash heaped him with praise and the craftsman left the palace with a true sense of having bested his old master and a future life of success and riches.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Jas'Mar Sokur never returned home. A jealous Pir'Lanash, could not contemplate Sokur ever making a piece more magnificent than The Heart. The Emperor's own guard waylaid Jas'Mar and the jewel crafter, the finest of his day, was never seen by man again.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{}}

But she was not always so.</p>\n<p>Her origins are mundane. O'Shan was born a shepherdess amogst the hills named Haran For. As was tradition in Meredin at the time, it was her mother who named Her. Her mother, Mar'Ion gave her the name Ros'Aria. Her father, Ket'Nagar Achan was likewise a shepherd. Living in those times was hard and the family was far from wealthy. They, nonetheless, worked hard and were close. </p>\n<p>They worshipped the gods diligently, a way of life that was becoming increasingly scorned. But they were popular members of their community where the gods still meant something. </p>\n<p>Then, life changed for all in their village. A change of governance of the province in which their village was located, all but outlawed the worship of the old gods, and task forces of men marauded the countryside searching for those who adhered to the old ways.</p>\n<p>They came upon Ros'Aria's village and on finding evidence they deemed against the law, brought 'justice' down upon the so-called offenders. That justice was cruel and brutal. The villagers could do nothing to prevent this, they did not have weapons and the were afraid. Some left for other parts of Meredin. Others gave up the religious practices they had followed for years. Others remained and worshipped in secret. Others still, seeing opportunities, betrayed their friends and families to the new overseers.</p>\n<p>As a village found to have, in some part, remained true to the old ways, they populace was exploited and terrorised. Many went missing. Many young women, including Ros'Aria were ravished by soldiers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-header\">\n<h2>The Rise of Ros'Aria</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"journal-content\">\n<p>But it was that experience that galvanised Ros'Aria. It filled her with hatred for the men who had violated her and others and through god-like strength of will began to plot and plan her revenge. It took months of hiding in fear of being found out, persuasion of those remaining in the village, but on one fateful day when the governor's soldiers rode into the village, they were ready. </p>\n<p>Led by Ros'Aria, they ambushed the soldiers who, taken by surprise were defeated. The people shouted the names of the old gods as they attacked. Leaving the village and emboldened by this victory, they marched to the next village. Word of what they had done was spread thoughout the area by the victors and slowly they gathered the people of many villages together. </p>\n<p>They advanced on the governor's manor where they met a force of soldiers. The governor had rightly deduced that his manor was where they would come and resolved that they would all meet their fate in front of the gates.</p>\n<p>Before the battle, Ros'Aria addressed the people, invoking the old gods against the tyranny of the governor and roused to a high of vengeance and bravery, the villagers using whatever weapon they were able to find chared upon the governor's soldiers. </p>\n<p>It is said that some of the soldiers broke ranks that day and fled. It is said that some, who held the old gods still with some favour laid down arms and refused to fight. What is known however, is that the villagers broke the ranks of the soldiers leaving swathes of them dead or dying and invaded the governor’s manor.</p>\n<p>Roaming the corridors and rooms they killed all who fought against them and capturing the rest. It was Ros'Aria herself who dealt a fatal blow to the governor, the names of the old gods on her lips.</p>\n<p>But it was not to go all as planned and tragedy struck when a stray arrow caught the young shepherdess and pierced her breast. </p>\n<p>Her funeral pyre was laid out and the remaining villagers, those who survived, paid respects to the one who had led them to the victory. It is said, sometime in witness accounts from the time, sometime in later writings, that as the pyre was lit, a great light came from above and gathered the body of Ros'Aria skywards. The people took this as a sign that the old gods had rewarded Ros'Aria's faith by elevating her to a goddess.</p>\n<p>Throughout the coming ages, the name of Ros'Aria was largely forgotten, being replaced by that of O'Shan. In older tongues this name means Sacrifice but others have speculated that it simply derives from Ros'Aria's surname of Achan.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{}}

Fortunately, its roots protruded from the forest floor and his resting place had been several feet above the sodden undergrowth. The morning was foggy, the branches of the other trees around came in and out of focus. And above all, there was the sound of the near incessant rain. He was protected from it somewhat this close to the trunk of the oak tree but he had to push on, so would soon be drenched. Looking around as the light grew was when he dimly saw the cottage, if such it was. It looked old and none too stable. Surely, it would provide better protection from the rain for a while. Just his luck, it had been dark when he arrived here. The odds had not been in his favour recently.</p>\n<p>Gathering up his possessions, he slung his pack over both shoulders. Then he strapped his rapier to his side, following his, by now, second-nature ritual of checking it sat correctly and that the blade was readily drawn. Then wiping the rain from his forehead, he carefully dropped down from the oak tree and picked his way through the tangle of branches to the dilapidated and rickety wooden building.</p>\n<p>He arrived at it quicker than he expected. The forest must have played tricks with his perception. Not surprising given the gloom. Before approaching the door, he stood and surveyed the structure. It was not completely constructed of wood as it turned out. That was surprising. It hardly seemed the easiest of locations to build a cottage of stone. He could only surmise that it was older than it looked, that it was built when the forest was not as thick as it was now. He took the remaining steps to the door. The door looked as ancient as the rest of the building but it still fitted snugly in the frame. Gingerly, he tested the handle, putting it through a quarter turn. No sound. Slowly he turned it the rest if the way until the door open with a gentle snick. He waited before entering. As nothing rushed suddenly at him he opened the door just enough that he could slip inside.</p>\n<p>The place smelled dank and musty. The sun was somewhat higher in the sky when he entered and reached high enough that it streamed through the only window in the room, a window that was surprisingly intact. Vilyack began to feel a very slight sense of unease. The room itself was relatively large, deceptively so. There was a fireplace on one wall and a large rank smelling rug laid in the exact middle of the room. Painting hung beside the fireplace and the opposite wall, the paint cracked and so filthy it was impossible to discern the subjects. Two old bookcases slumped against the other walls and a number of chairs lay about the floor. In their day they would have been quite opulent, now Vilyack assumed that their springs couldn't be trusted.</p>\n<p>In the far corner was a set of double doors. So there was more to this cottage than a simple room. Vilyack was so used to being careful, he could not relax until he had explored the remaining areas of the cottage. He strode over to the doors. They were not locked and looked as unusually intact as the door through which he had entered. Opening them, he found himself in a largish anteroom, debris strewn on the floor. Wood, paper, rusted metal. There was furniture here too but he was more interested in what lay behind the doors that led off the room.</p>\n<p>They were most likely to be bedrooms. he thought. The doors, once more opened without difficulty revealing exactly what he had expected to see. A further set of double doors stood opposite the bedrooms. These were empty anyway other than a bed and some random animal bones.</p>\n<p>Opening the double doors, he found himself in another room, four wooden pillars holding up the leaking roof. And, also, stairs. So there was a cellar? The stairs led down to blackness. Vilyack was not one to be afraid of the dark, so he descended with barely a pause.</p>\n<p>The stairs ended in doors which he opened. He entered the cellar.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>And the darkness swallowed him.</p>\n<p>Swirling, thick clouds of it, ever moving, coiling around him. It was oppressive but seemed weightless. It smelled of nothing, was so insubstantial he could not feel it. It was simply clouds that comprised of the complete absence of light. However, it was not so thick that Vilyack could not catch glimpses of what lay within it. He was in a room that contained some packing crates and bones. There were dark stains on the threadbare carpet on the floor. Blood?</p>\n<p>He moved a little further in. Instantly, he felt a sharp pain in his neck. And a hint of breath.</p>\n<p>    \"Who are you? Tell me - quickly.\" The voice was soft and accented. It also belonged to a woman.</p>\n<p>Where had she been hiding? <em>Why</em> had she been hiding? Had she been behind him when he entered the cellar?</p>\n<p>    \"I said quickly...\" the woman whispered a touch more intently. Whatever was pressed against his neck did so with a hint more pressure.</p>\n<p>    \"Vilyack, my name is Vilyack.\"</p>\n<p>    \"And where are you from ... Vilyack?\"</p>\n<p>    \"Oray. It's on the east coast.\"</p>\n<p>    \"Well, Vilyack of Oray, tell me something no-one else knows about you.\" The pressure of what he by now assumed was the point of a blade increased just a little more, just to emphasise her demand. Vilyack was sure he could feel a slight trickle of blood slide down his neck.</p>\n<p>    \"But why, what is it you want?\"</p>\n<p>    \"I <em>wan</em>t you to to tell me something <em>about</em> yourself.\"</p>\n<p>Vilyack sighed and thought for a second or two. \"As a boy I had to run a race, which I won. At the end we had to run back to pick up the prize. But he boy who was in second ran past me and claimed the first prize. I hated him for that.\", he told the invisible woman.</p>\n<p>There was a pause for maybe half a minute. Vilyack held his breath, unmoving. Then suddenly the pressure was gone.</p>\n<p>    \"Thank you, Vilyack of Oray. I apologise. I had to make sure you were, well.... you.\"</p>\n<p>The woman's voice came from the centre of the room. Vilyack was sure he had not felt her move.</p>\n<p>    \"What say you we get out of this rather depressing room?\", she said. He felt her move past him to the door and her footsteps were clear as she climbed the stairs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Vilyack followed the woman up the stairs. After all, he wasn't going to stay down there in the darkness. By the time he reached the top of the stairs, she had moved through the other rooms and he found her waiting in the main 'living-room'. Now he could see her clearly, he could see that she was dressed in black leather armour with gold chasing along the edges of the various plates and layers. He had to blink and look again several times as it seemed that when she moved, her armour shifted in colour: from black to a kind of midnight blue, flecks of gold flickering as they caught the light, like stars. She wore a mask that reached up from her chin to cover all but her eyes and forehead. Her eyes were of a bright hazel and she stood there looking at him, her gaze steady as if appraising him. At her right hip was a dagger of somewhat unusual design, at her left a sword, obsidian black from scabbard to hilt. She wore a a cream coloured hood that covered the rest if her head.</p>\n<p>    \"Why don't you sit down, Vilyack of Oray,\" she invited him, gesturing with both hands to any of the chairs in the room.</p>\n<p>    \"Hmm! I'd rather stand. You appear to have some knowledge of me, but who are you?\"</p>\n<p>    \"Well, my name is...\" The woman paused for a few seconds, thoughtful, as if trying to decide on a name to give. \"Emily.\", she said finally.</p>\n<p>    \"And that's it? That's all you are going to tell me?\"</p>\n<p>    \"It's virtually all I am permitted to tell you. About myself that is. But it is no accident we meet here.\"</p>\n<p>    \"Really? And what is it you want of me... <span data-tool-tip=\"Vilyack is pretty certain that Emily is not her real name!\">Emily</span>?\" Vilyack said the last with a touch of emphasis, like he was going along with the ruse.</p>\n<p>    \"I am not here, wherever exactly here is, on my own behalf. I have been sent to guide you, perhaps aid you in the beginning of a certain task.\"</p>\n<p>    \"Which is?\" Vilyack was already a little tired of the mystery. He was disappointed when it continued.</p>\n<p>    \"I remain unaware of the full nature of what it is you are meant to do, other than you are particularly suited to it. You are one of relatively few in this world who see beyond the mundane. That and your other skills are required.\"</p>\n<p>    \"Still, to do <em>what</em>?\"</p>\n<p>    \"The world, all worlds really, require balance. Good does not exist without evil, nor evil without good. There are those that play at either end of the spectrum and some who inhabit the centre of it. You have been chosen to aid in keeping the balance. This is something you do already. I believe that only now, you would work on a higher level and for greater stakes.\"</p>\n<p>    \"If you expect me to do evil to keep the balance, I will not. And you can go. You have said nothing to persuade me.\"</p>\n<p>    \"Hmm. And what is evil Vilyack? Nothing, but the opposite of what you believe. And if that is true for you, is it not also true for those you consider 'evil'. Adherants to either side both believe that they are doing the right thing. Do you consider killing to be evil? If someone you consider 'good' is killed you look on it as an 'evil' act. And so you feel justified in killing the perpetrator of that act, because you are 'good' and 'justice' must be served. Those who occupy the centre ground, however, would consider all killing wrong. By that standard, are you not already 'evil'?</p>\n<p>    \"I am, however, not here to debate moral philosophy with you. I am also not asking you to go against your nature, Vilyack. Just to keep doing what you do. But there is more out there than you know. I am here to point you in the right direction, set you on the path and lead you to the tools you will need. If you like, I am offering you a place at a higher table.\"</p>\n<p>    Vilyack stood for a while and contemplated Emily's words. \"Alright,\" he said eventually. \"But before all that, I'm starving. I need food. And beer. I haven't had one of those in longer than I would wish.\"</p>\n<p>    Emily looked at him, again with those appraising eyes. After a few moments, she nodded and slung a bag from her shoulder. It was not particularly large. She reached in and brought out bread and cheese and cold meat, handing them to Vilyack who, throwing decorum to the high winds, ate them as if he had not eaten in weeks, which was not far from the truth. </p>\n<p>So wrapped up in eating was he that it took Emily clearing her throat rather loudly for him to look up and notice the proffered bottled of beer in her hand. Eyes widening, he raised them to look at her. Her eyes told him she was smiling. She shrugged one shoulder enigmatically as he took the bottle and drank down the surprisingly cool liquid. It tasted like dreams come true. He couldn't quite be sure but he thought he heard her speak under her breath. \"Men!\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>    \"When you're finished, we should go. The way is not far, but we have to move through the forest, so it will take some time. Overnight, at least.\" Emily slung her backpack over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>Vilyack nodded, belched quietly, surreptitiously slid the empty bottle under the mouldy couch upon which he sat and stood up.</p>\n<p>    \"Alright, Emily, lead on.\"</p>\n<p>The rain had eased by the time they left the cottage and eventually it stopped altogether and sunlight managed to reach through the trees to dapple the forest floor. It was, as Emily had said, rough going and they had to make camp for the night. They built a small fire but it was smoky from the damp wood and gave little heat. Still it was enough to warm some more food Emily pulled from her pack. Vilyack was happy that she also managed to produce another couple of bottles of beer from there too. She did not drink herself, however.</p>\n<p>Midway through the second day they arrived at a dark glade. Old stone steps led down to a depression where Vilyack could see four stones standing in its centre.</p>\n<p>    \"Wait a moment. This is not quite where we need to be.\" Emily said, putting a hand on his arm.</p>\n<p>She made some gestures with her hands and for around half a minutes spoke whispered words Vilyack could not quite pick out. Emily's made a sudden movement and the area began to change. Light appeared in the centre of the stones revealing a circle. Hazy bluish fog surrounded them. The stairs looked different now, newer, the moss that had covered them gone. Across the glad more stairs appeared, leading to an entrance flanked by carvings of skulls. It appeared that they had been carved out of the solid rock, larger ones on the inside, reducing in size as they fanned outwards.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-base\"><img src=\"modules/ash-keron-journals/assets/journal-misc/skull-gorge-crop.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"192\" /></div>\n<p>    \"That,\" said Emily pointing to the entrance, \"is where we must go. But, be aware, this place is not unguarded. And I am not permitted to aid you in any fight here.\"</p>\n<p><em>Why am I not surprised</em>? thought Vilyack as he began to walk towards the stairs.</p>\n<p>Emily followed him, her eyes keen. They walked down the stairs and into the sunken glade. The mist swirled around them. It was bright but did not hamper Vilyack's vision. Then, from his left, there was a shout, a challenge and the scream of a foe rushing towards him.</p>\n<p>As it happened, the fight was over quickly and efficiently from Vilyack's point of view at least. A second attacker had run at him out of the mist, from the circle between the standing stones. Then a third as they approached the stairs on the far side of the glade. As they mounted the steps, Vilyack had only sustained some minor cuts from the encounters.</p>\n<p>    \"Impressive,\" complimented Emily as they reached the top of the stairs, \"I have not seen anyone fight with quite your style. However, I fear that these men were easy prey compared to what lies ahead. Here, let me see to that wound.\"</p>\n<p>Emily bound the slice on Vilyack's arm after which they stood contemplating the entrance to whatever came next.</p>\n<p>    \"Are you ready?\"</p>\n<hr /></div>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61e059fe4e9d10cc5a7b2b96/character-assets/pc/portraits/mysterious-emily.jpg","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"journals.SanseerEmptyJournal"},"exportSource":{"world":"san-katarin","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.280","systemVersion":"3.13.6"}}}

The rumour that Jar Kamal owed his power over the Society to some ancient artefact, that he used to warp the minds of others, was what had attracted Vilyack to investigate in the first place. Normally, such things were simply that - rumours. But, something in those whispered tales had sparked his intrigue. Further investigations in the town had supported them. It was, of course, unwise to ask about these things openly. Vilyack had learned careful circumspection when chasing down the untoward in this world.</p>\n<p>What he had learned had led him to the main location of the Society. It was not where generally thought. An easy ruse to keep things hidden. As he had approached, he had been careful, made no noise, was sure he was not seen. His better than normal vision afforded him the ability to avoid the sight of normal men. But then he was spotted by one of Kamal's henchmen lurking outside. Just his luck that the man was not actually human but a dwarf. Nothing in his knowledge gathering had thrown up Kamal having such folk in his employ. Scrawny bastard could see fully in the dark and Vilyack hadn't seen him coming. And despite the dwarf's diminutive and rather malnournished-looking form, the bastard had packed some power into the punch that had made Vilyack see galaxies floating before his eyes.</p>\n<p>Quite a lot of what happened next was a blur. That was fortunate as quite a lot of what happened next was painful. He had been pulled to and from unconsciousness in the Society's attempts to squeeze information out of him. To his knowledge, he had divulged nothing, but as his memory was blurry he couldn't be sure. In fact he could barely remember any of the questions asked of him. In the end their frustration with him made them sloppy. In his few lucid moments during the torture, this was what he had been hoping for. A knot tied just not quite right, a chain not as taught as it could be, a weapon just a little closer to the table upon which he lay than was wise. Vilyack bided his time through the pain and waited. </p>\n<p>The opportunity came just when he thought he could not last much longer without being too weak to move. Some artful contortions loosened, then freed him from the rope and the chain, allowing him to reach the weapon. Arranging things so he looked still bound, he waited until his torturer came just a little too close. The man liked to gloat over his victims. His surprise when Vilyack thrust the blade into his throat was sublime to see. There was no time for gloating of his own however. Swift and clinical were the watchwords now.</p>\n<p>Gathering what he could see of his belongings, which was most of them as it happened. His favourite dagger was missing, he reckoned that was to be expected, after all, though not fancy, it was well made and well balanced. Still, his continuing to live was more important. </p>\n<p>Vilyack rifled the dead torturer's body, robbing him of what little coin the man had. Eventually, he found the keys. Moving as quietly as he could, he slipped out of the torture room door. He had memorised the way he had been taken in but knew that would only lead back to the heart of the place. His recconnoitering beforehand had revealed a less trodden way into the Society's compound and he believed that he knew the way out.</p>\n<p>His plan worked after a fashion. </p>\n<p>He had to knife another man to death on the way out but before he died he had managed to let out a cry. Dogs instantly began barking and shouts and commotion rose from the compound. Vilyack broke into a run. As was his usual modus operandi, he had carefully surveyed the surroundings prior to attempting the break-in and had at least some idea of the best way to flee. The dogs worried him. They were faster than him, especially after the ministrations of that dead fucker he'd left in the torture room. But he had ways to fools the hounds.</p>\n<p>He came across a river. Neither deep nor fast flowing, its direction was downwind of the dogs. He ran up its center. Glancing back to check on any pursuit, he spied several sprays of slimewort cascading over the bank. He may just have time. Stopping, he doubled back, grabbing handfuls of the pungent and greasy plant and, finding a tree thick enough to hide him, smeared the stuff over his boots, trousers and upper garments. It was never going to be a perfect disguise for his scent but that and the river would help. </p>\n<p>Forsaking the river for now, he ran through the trees for as long as he could until the baying of the dogs ceased. Then he ran some more. Only when his body could take no more did he fall to the ground to rest, covering himself with leaves and twigs and moss, as much for warmth as concealment.</p>\n<p>He was angry at himself for such an ignominious exit. It would be some time before he was fully recovered from the torture, so he decided to move further south and find some place to rest up for  a few days. Unfortunately, such places were not easily forthcoming and he had been forced to sleep under trees. To make matters worse the weather had changed and the rain was near incessant.</p>\n<p>On the 7th day after escaping he woke up, damp and cold. It had been dark when he had decided to sleep here, and so he had been unaware of the dilapidated structure that he could now see through the dim sunlight penetrating the tree canopy.</p>\n<p>Surely, it was better than sleeping in the open...</p>\n</div>\n<p><img class=\"journal-image-margin journal-image-circle\" src=\"modules/ash-keron-journals/assets/journal-misc/forest-cabin.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n</div>","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61e059fe4e9d10cc5a7b2b96/journal-assets/misc/forest-cabin.jpg","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"WnvjjdNCl158346A":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"journals.SanseerEmptyJournal"},"exportSource":{"world":"san-katarin","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.280","systemVersion":"3.13.6"}}}

Often seen around the city dressed in opulent clothing, his attitude to those who encountered him was supercilious and condescending. He was, clearly, in possession of funds however, and local tradesmen found it hard to refuse to deal with him. Of those who were artisans of some nature, most did not understand the designs he asked them to create.</p>\n<p>His arrival in Halith came around 12 years ago, in the year 863 as the passage of time is reckoned in Ash Keron. He immediately set up premises in the Masan area of the city. These premises contained his living quarters and a workshop.
